# API Client Generator for Java

A generator for protocol buffer described APIs for and in Java.

This is a generator for API client libraries for APIs specified by protocol
buffers, such as those inside Google. It takes a protocol buffer (with
particular annotations) and uses it to generate a client library.

## Purpose

This generator will eventually replace the Java parts of the
[older monolithic generator](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator).

## Disclaimer

This generator is currently experimental. Please don't use it for anything
mission-critical.
